How to make Golden Corn Pizza

Step 1
To make a simple pizza base at home, take the milk and put it in a pot to get it slightly warm. Once 
done, pour it out in a large bowl. Then take a large bowl and add the all purpose flour in it. Using the
 warm milk and water, knead the flour into a soft dough.

Step 2
Now add a teaspoon of yeast in this dough and mix again. Then cover the bowl with a plastic wrap and let 
the dough sit for about 25 mins.

Step 3
After a while, once again knead the dough for 2-3 mins. Let it sit for another 40 mins while covered 
with a plastic wrap or lid.

Step 4
Now take the dough and knead once more for about 2-3 mins. Then take a big portion of the dough and 
place it on a flat surface. Using a big rolling pin, roll it into pizza base. Sprinkle dry flour if the 
dough sticks to the surface.

Step 5
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Celsius. Now, in a large bowl, grate mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, 
and cheddar cheese and add corn kernels. Mix them all together.

Step 6
Now, take the pizza base and spread a thin layer of tomato ketchup on it. Then, spread a thick layer of 
pizza sauce on it. Finally, top it with the cheese-corn mixture generously.

Step 7
Now, grease a baking tray and put the prepared pizza on it. Place it in the oven and bake for 10-12 
minutes, or until the cheese on top starts turning golden. When done, glaze it with olive oil pomace.
