Pizza is a type of food that was created in Italy. It is made by adding "toppings". Some of the most 
common toppings are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These 
toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce. The sauce is most often tomato-based, but 
butter-based sauces are used, too. The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". Almost any kind 
of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. 
Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine. However, it has become popular in many parts of the 
world.

Pizza is an emerging fast food in India. Domestic pizza brands include U.S. Pizza, Smokin' Joes and 
Pizza Corner. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India. Pizza brands feature greater "recipe 
localization" from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to 
other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in 
other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India 
instead of Parmesan cheese. In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza 
also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.

Pizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and paneer. More 
conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants,
 available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at 
 specialty restaurants.
